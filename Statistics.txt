Solution for Question 1:

 In this case correlation coefficient is 0.7 that indicates a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA.
The more the value is towards +1 the more positive correlated it is.
The more the value iis towards -1 the more negative correlated it is.
If zero the there is no linear relationship between 2.

The correlation coefficient value is positive when it shows that there is a correlation between the two values and the negative value shows the amount of diversity among the two values.

Formula for  correlation coefficient can be given as:

r = n ∑ X Y − ∑ X ∑ Y ( n ∑ X 2 − ( ∑ X ) 2 ) ⋅ ( n ∑ Y 2 − ( ∑ Y ) 2 )

where,
    n	   Quantity of Information
    Σx   Total of the First Variable Value
    Σy   Total of the Second Variable Value
    Σxy  Sum of the Product of   & Second Value
    Σx2  Sum of the Squares of the First Value
    Σy2  Sum of the Squares of the Second Value

So here correlation coefficient is 0.7 that means as SAT score increase, college GPA also tends to increase.

Solution for Question 2:


First, we need to calculate the z-scores for the heights of 160 cm and 180 cm. The formula for calculating the z-score is:

z = (x - μ) / σ

where:
x = individual height
μ = mean height
σ = standard deviation

For 160 cm:
z1 = (160 - 170) / 10 = -1

For 180 cm:
z2 = (180 - 170) / 10 = 1

Now, we can use the z-scores to find the corresponding probabilities using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator. The probability between two z-scores represents the percentage of individuals in the dataset with heights within that range.

The probability of having a z-score between -1 and 1 is approximately 0.6827. Therefore, approximately 68.27% of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm and 180 cm.

b. When randomly selecting a sample of 100 individuals from the dataset, the distribution of sample means will also follow a normal distribution. The mean of the sample means will be equal to the population mean (170 cm in this case), and the standard deviation of the sample means will be equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (10 cm / √100 = 1 cm).

To find the probability that the average height of the 100 randomly selected individuals is greater than 175 cm, we can calculate the z-score for 175 cm using the same formula as before:

z = (x - μ) / σ

where:
x = individual height (175 cm)
μ = mean height (170 cm)
σ = standard deviation of the sample means (1 cm)

z = (175 - 170) / 1 = 5

Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we can find the probability of having a z-score greater than 5. This probability is extremely small and can be considered close to zero. Therefore, the probability that the average height of the 100 randomly selected individuals is greater than 175 cm is approximately zero.

c. To find the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm, we can use the formula:

z = (x - μ) / σ

where:
x = individual height (185 cm)
μ = mean height (170 cm)
σ = standard deviation (10 cm)

z = (185 - 170) / 10 = 1.5

Therefore, the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm is 1.5.

d. We know that 5% of the dataset has heights below a certain value. This corresponds to the 5th percentile of the normal distribution. To find the approximate height corresponding to this threshold, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the z-score corresponding to the 5th percentile.

The z-score for the 5th percentile is approximately -1.645. We can use this z-score to calculate the corresponding height:

z = (x - μ) / σ

-1.645 = (x - 170) / 10

Solving for x:

-1.645 * 10 = x - 170

-16.45 + 170 = x

x ≈ 153.55

Therefore, the approximate height corresponding to the threshold where 5% of the dataset has heights below is approximately 153.55 cm.


e. To calculate the CV for the given dataset, we can use the formula:

CV = (σ / μ) * 100

where:
σ = standard deviation
μ = mean

In this case, the mean height is 170 cm, and the standard deviation is 10 cm:

CV = (10 / 170) * 100 ≈ 5.88%

Therefore, the coefficient of variation (CV) for the dataset is approximately 5.88%.


f. Calculate the skewness of the dataset and interpret the result
 Skewness can be calculated using the formula:

Skewness = (3 * (Mean - Median)) / Standard Deviation

If the skewness is:

Greater than 0: The distribution is right-skewed (positively skewed), meaning the tail is 
longer on the right side.
Equal to 0: The distribution is perfectly symmetric.
Less than 0: The distribution is left-skewed (negatively skewed), meaning the tail is longer on the left side.
In this case, the dataset is approximately normally distributed, and its skewness is approximately zero. Since a skewness of zero indicates a symmetric distribution, it means that the heights in the dataset are evenly distributed around the mean without any significant skew towards higher or lower values.

Therefore, the skewness of the dataset is approximately zero, indicating a symmetric distribution.

Solution for question 4:

To find the probability of the drawing a paper slip with a perfect square number from a hat, we have to use the formula for probability of an event which is given by,

P(E)=Number of favourable outcomes/Total number of outcomes
     We have to find the number of perfect squares from 1 to 20 and divide it by the total number of paper slip.

The perfect squares from 1 to 20 are 1, 4, 9, 16. Therefore, the number of favourable outcomes is 4. Total number of outcomes will be 20 since we are looking for perfect squares from 1 to 20.
⇒ P(perfect square)= 4/20
   P = 0.2 or 20%

Hence, the probability of drawing a perfect square number from the hat is 0.2 or 20%.

Solution for question 5: 

A   :Company A has 80% of the taxis 
P(A) : Probability that a randomly selected taxi belongs to Company A is 0.8
B   :Company B has 20% of the taxis
P(B) :Probability that a randomly selected taxi belongs to Company B is 0.2
L   :Taxi is late
P(L) :Probability that a randomly selected taxi is late

To findthe probability that a randomly selected taxi belongs to Company A is late given by P(A|L)

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|L) = (P(L|A) * P(A)) / P(L)

P(L|A) is the probability that the taxi is late given that it belongs to Company A, which is 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 (since the success rate is 95%).
P(L|B) is the probability that the taxi is late given that it belongs to Company B, which is 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 (since the success rate is 90%).

P(L) = P(L|A) * P(A) + P(L|B) * P(B)
P(L) = 0.05 * 0.8 + 0.10 * 0.2
          = 0.04 + 0.02
          = 0.06

P(A|L) = (0.05 * 0.8) / 0.06
              = 0.04 / 0.06
      = 0.6667

Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected taxi is from Company A, given that it is late, is approximately 0.6667 or 66.67%.



To perform the calculations and interpretations requested, we will first calculate the dispersion, mean and confidence interval, mean absolute deviation (MAD), standard deviation, and correlation coefficient for the given data. Let's proceed with the calculations:

a. Measure the dispersion in both and interpret the results:
Dispersion measures the extent of spread or variability in a dataset. There are various measures of dispersion, including range, interquartile range (IQR), and standard deviation. In this case, we will calculate the range and IQR for both the 'Blood Pressure Before' and 'Blood Pressure After' columns.

Range:
The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.

Range of 'Blood Pressure Before': 145 - 120 = 25
Range of 'Blood Pressure After': 141 - 118 = 23

Interquartile Range (IQR):
The IQR is the range of the middle 50% of the data, which is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1).

Q1 and Q3 of 'Blood Pressure Before':
Q1 = 128
Q3 = 139
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 139 - 128 = 11

Q1 and Q3 of 'Blood Pressure After':
Q1 = 122
Q3 = 132
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 132 - 122 = 10

Interpretation:
The range of both 'Blood Pressure Before' and 'Blood Pressure After' indicates the spread of the data from the lowest to the highest values. The IQR provides a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of the data, excluding outliers. In this case, the IQR for both columns is relatively small, indicating that the central portion of the data is concentrated within a narrow range.

b. Calculate mean and 5% confidence interval and plot it in a graph:
To calculate the mean and confidence interval,

Mean:
Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)

Mean of 'Blood Pressure Before':
(130 + 142 + 120 + ... + 139 + 135 + 130) / 100

Mean of 'Blood Pressure After':
(120 + 135 + 118 + ... + 139 + 135 + 124) / 100

Confidence Interval:
Confidence Interval = Mean ± (Critical value * Standard deviation / sqrt(Number of values))

The critical value for a 5% confidence interval with 99 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.984.


c. Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Standard Deviation:
Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):
MAD measures the average absolute difference between each data point and the mean. It is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences divided by the number of values.

Standard Deviation:
Standard Deviation measures the average deviation of the data points from the mean. It is calculated as the square root of the variance, where the variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.

To calculate MAD and Standard Deviation, we'll use the following formulas:

MAD = (Sum of absolute differences) / (Number of values)
Standard Deviation = sqrt((Sum of squared differences) / (Number of values))

Interpretation:
MAD provides an average measure of the absolute variability from the mean, while standard deviation measures the dispersion of data points



d. Calculate the correlation coefficient (r):

We can use the formula to calculate the correlation coefficient (r):

r = (n * ∑(X * Y) - (∑X * ∑Y)) / sqrt((n * ∑(X^2) - (∑X)^2) * (n * ∑(Y^2) - (∑Y)^2))

Solution for question 7:


Given:
Equation of the regression line for X on Y: 2X + 3Y - 8 = 0
Equation of the regression line for Y on X: 2Y + X - 5 = 0
Variance of X (Var(X)) = 4

a. Variance of Y (Var(Y)):
To find the variance of Y, we need to first find the slope of the regression line for Y on X. From the equation 2Y + X - 5 = 0, we can rearrange it to Y = (-1/2)X + 5/2. The slope of this line is -1/2.
The variance of Y is given by Var(Y) = slope^2 * Var(X).
Substituting the values, we have:
Var(Y) = (-1/2)^2 * 4 = 1.

Therefore, the variance of Y (Var(Y)) is 1.

b. Coefficient of determination (R-squared) of X and Y:
The coefficient of determination (R-squared) measures the proportion of the variance in one variable that can be explained by the other variable. In this case, we can calculate the R-squared for X on Y and for Y on X.

For X on Y:
R-squared(X|Y) = (slope^2 * Var(X)) / Var(Y).
Substituting the values, we have:
R-squared(X|Y) = (2^2 * 4) / 1 = 16.

For Y on X:
R-squared(Y|X) = (slope^2 * Var(Y)) / Var(X).
Substituting the values, we have:
R-squared(Y|X) = ((-1/2)^2 * 1) / 4 = 1/8.

Therefore, the coefficient of determination of X on Y (R-squared(X|Y)) is 16, and the coefficient of determination of Y on X (R-squared(Y|X)) is 1/8.

c. Standard error of estimate of X on Y and of Y on X:
The standard error of estimate measures the average distance between the actual data points and the regression line. It quantifies the accuracy of the regression model.

For X on Y:
Standard error of estimate of X on Y (SEest(X|Y)) is given by the formula:
SEest(X|Y) = sqrt((1 - R-squared(X|Y)) * Var(X)).
Substituting the values, we have:
SEest(X|Y) = sqrt((1 - 16) * 4) = sqrt(-60) = undefined.

For Y on X:
Standard error of estimate of Y on X (SEest(Y|X)) is given by the formula:
SEest(Y|X) = sqrt((1 - R-squared(Y|X)) * Var(Y)).
Substituting the values, we have:
SEest(Y|X) = sqrt((1 - 1/8) * 1) = sqrt(7/8).

Therefore, the standard error of estimate of X on Y (SEest(X|Y)) is undefined, and the standard error of estimate of Y on X (SEest(Y|X)) is sqrt(7/8).

Solution for question 8:


To test whether the therapy had a significant effect on anxiety levels or not, we need to follow the follwing steps given  below:

Step 1 - State the Null and Altenate Hypothesis
Step 2: From difference calculate R positive and R negative
Step 3: To calculate no of sample, Mean, S.D, Z:
Step 4: Calculate Tabulated Z value
Step 5: Compare the Calulated and Tabulated Z value
Step 7: Take Decision


First let us set the the Null and Altenate Hypothesis:
H0= Have therapy effect
H1= does not have therapy effect


Participant	Before Therapy 	After Therapy	Difference
1	               10	   7	           -3
2	                8	   6	           -2
3	               12	   10	           -2
4	               15	   12	           -3
5	                6	    5	           -1
6	                9	    8	           -1
7	               11	    9	           -2
8	                7	    6	           -1
9	               14	   12	           -2
10	               10	    8	           -2


In order to acppect or reject our Null Hypothesis we need to conclude that
If Ztab > Zcal than we accept H0.
If Ztab < Zcal than we fail to accept H0.

We use Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test whether the therapy had a significant effect on anxiety levels.

To Calculate R negative and R positive:
R negative = 55
R positive = 0


To calculate no of sample, Mean, S.D, Z:
n = 9.5


Mean = n(n+1)/4
     = 9.5(9.5 + 1)/4
     = 24.9
  
S.D = SQRT{[n(n+1)(2n+1)]/24}
    = SQRT{[9.5(9.5 + 1)(2 * 9.5 + 1)] / 24}
    = SQRT{[9.5*(10.5)*(20)/ 24]}
    = SQRT[1995 / 24]
Standard Deviation = 9.11


Z  = |R - Mean|/Standard Deviation
   = |55 - 24.9|/9.11
   = 30.1/9.11
   = 3.30
Zcal = 3.30

With 5% significance value to calculate Ztab:

Tabulated Z value: Ztab = 1.96

If Ztab > Zcal than we accept H0.
As we observe here Ztab < Zcal we fail to accept our H0.

Take the Decision:
Hence therapy doesn't have significant effect on anixiety level.

Let us consider Column Exam 1 as A, Exam 2 as B and Final Exam as C.

To first set the Null Hypothesis,
H0= Mean score of all student same
H1 = Mean Score of all student not same

Name	Exam 1	Exam 2	Final Exam
Karan	  85	  90	  92
Deepa	  70	  80	  85
Karthik	  90	  85	  88
Chandan	  75	  70	  75
Jeevan	  95	  92	  96



To calculate mean for Exam 1, Exam 2, and Final Exam
_          _            _
Xa = 83 ,  Xb = 83.4 ,  Xc = 87.2
                               

To find Grand Avergae Mean:  
_    _    _     _
x̅  = (  Xa + Xb  + Xc) / 3
_ 
x̅  =  84.5



Calulate S.S.C (Sum of square between Samples):
_    _
Xa - x̅  =  83 - 84.5
       = -1.5
  _    _ 
( Xa - x̅  )^2 = 8.45

_    _
Xb - x̅ = 83.4 - 84.5
       = -1.1
  _    _
( Xb - x̅ )^2 = 6.05
_    _
Xc - x̅ = 87.2 - 84.5
       = 2.7
  _    _
( Xc - x̅ )^2 = 5.4

 S.S.C (Sum of square between Samples) = 8.45 + 6.05 + 5.4
 So,  S.S.C (Sum of square between Samples)  = 19.9



To calculate S.S.E ( Sum of Square with Samples):
    _
A - Xa = 
      _
( A - Xa)^2 = 441.25
    _
B - Xb = 
      _
( B - Xb)^2 = 317.25
    _
C - Xc = 
     _
(C - Xc)^2 = 291.25

S.S.E ( Sum of Square with Samples) =  441.25 + 317.25 + 291.28 
S.S.E ( Sum of Square with Samples) =  1049.6


To Calculate F Ratio:

Source of Variation	Sum of Squares	        Degree of Freedom	           Mean Sum of Squares	F
				
Between Sample	        S.S.C = 19.9	          v1 = c -1 = 2	            M.S.C = S.S.C/c-1	Fcal = M.S.C/M.S.E
			                                                                                                                                             =9.95	                               =0.11
Within Sample	        S.S.E = 1049.6	          v2 = n - c= 15-3 = 12	    M.S.    = S.S.E/n-c	
			                                                                                                                                              = 87.46	

Tabulated F value: Ftab for D.O.F 2,12 = 3.89

If Fcal < F tab we will accept Null Hypothesis
If Fcal > Ftab we wil reject Null Hypothesis

Here, Ftab > Fcal i.e 3.89 > 0.11 so we accept NUll Hypothesis.
Hence Mean score of all the students are same

Solution for question 12:

We need to follow the following steps to calculate the t-Test:

Step 1 - State the Null and Altenate Hypothesis
Step 2 - Calculate degree of freedom
Step 3 - Calculate t-Test
Step 4 - Compare the Test 
Step 5 - Take Decision

Firestly we set the Hypothesis:

H0 = Haa Effect
H1 = Does not has effect

Significance level is given as 0.05%

To calculate the Degree of freedom:
Degree of Freedom: n-1
30-1 = 29


Decision Rule:
As it is two tailed,the area covered under significance level is 0.025  (in refference with T Table) 
If the T test is less than -2.045 and greater than +2.045, than we Reject the Null Hypothesis

Now to calculate t-Test:
t1 = sample mean - population mean / Ssample deviation * sqrt(no. of samples)
Population mean not given, we will only consider sample mean.
  = 2.5/0.8 * sqrt(30)
  = 0.57
Here t1 is less than 2.045.


t2 = sample mean - population mean / Ssample deviation * sqrt(no. of samples)
Population mean not given, we will only consider sample mean.
  =  2.2/0.6 * sqrt(30)
  = 0.65
Here t2 is less than 2.045.

a. To calculate the Difference:  t2-t1 = 0.65 - 0.57 = 0.08
   Hence we can see there is no significant difference in the mean improvement scores between two groups.

b. As value of t-Test is less than 2.045 and greater than -2.045, we Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis.
Conclusion: 	Hence we conclude that the new drug has its effectiveness against a standard drug for treating a particular condition.
